Hi, I'm Anna. I'm a software engineer. I like solving problems with code. I usually learn some things along the way. Check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a> to see what I've been working on.

I've been lucky enough to have spent this past year working as a backend engineer using Clojure where I got to discover lots of neat functional programming concepts like pure functions, immutable data structures, and the glory of rainbow parens. I'm now heading to the Recurse Center where I'm hoping to dive deeper into CS fundamentals, networking, and more Clojure!
